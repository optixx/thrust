This file describes how to build and install thrust in the SDL1-only port.

1. What you need to build and install thrust

  * An ANSI C compiler.
  * GNU make (it can run the helper programs that transform the data files).
  * SDL v1.2 development headers and libraries; the build uses `sdl-config` to find the right flags.
    If `sdl-config` is not installed, set `SDLCONFIG=/path/to/sdl-config` before running `make`.
  * Pod2man (part of Perl) to regenerate the man page from `thrust.pod` if you ever edit it.
  * The netpbm tools if you need to rebuild any of the Pictures-to-C conversions under `datasrc`.

2. Building thrust

  * Run `make sdlthrust` to compile the single supported target. Pass `SOUND=yes` if you need to rebuild
    the sound tables as well.
  * Helper targets such as `make clean`, `make distclean`, and `make dist` still exist to tidy or
    package the source tree.

3. Installing thrust

  * Type `sudo make install` to drop `sdlthrust` into `/usr/local/bin` (or set `prefix`/`bindir` in
    the Makefile if you prefer another location).
  * Run `sudo make install-man` to install the man page under `/usr/local/share/man/man6`.
  * The highscore file defaults to `/usr/local/com/thrust.highscore`; the directory is created if it
    does not exist.

4. Ship it

  * `make dist` creates a source tarball (`thrust-0.89c.src.tar.gz`).
  * `make bindist` creates a binary tarball containing the cleaned source tree plus the built `sdlthrust`.
