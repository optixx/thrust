Version 0.90 December 19, 2025

* Consolidated the build to the SDL2/macOS-only target: the Makefile now only builds `sdlthrust`, removes legacy `install/TAGS/DVI` targets, keeps the asset pipeline intact, and hardcodes SDL2 as the linker dependency.
* Always initialize SDL sound, eliminate the old `HAVE_SOUND` preprocessor guards, and drop the `play_sound` flag so the SDL mixer is the single sound path.
* Modernized configuration loading: `conf.c` now reads `thrust.rc` from the executable directory, logs loading/parsing progress, and only understands SDL-based entries, while `SDLkey.c` feeds SDL names/codes back to the configuration screen.
* Reworked the SDL input stack so `wait_for_key()` returns SDL2 keycodes, `SDLkey` helpers translate to/from SDL names, and the main loop uses plain SDL event handling with constant frame pacing; the sample `thrust.rc` now ships beside the game.


Version 0.89c-sdl1-current

* Renamed `datasrc/` to `assets/` and updated the Makefile to match the new layout.


Version 0.89c-sdl1 November 11, 2011

* Added SDL support


Version 0.89c September 30, 2001

* Fixed an escape sequence bug in the man page source.

* Fixed the description of the .thrustrc file in the man page to use a list.

* Silenced a couple of warnings.

* Changed the Makefile so that all .c files in datasrc/ are really prebuilt
  and also fixed it so that the prebuilt versions are used when building. This
  should specifically remove the build dependency on the netpbm package.

* Fixed the thrust.html ducumentation target.

* Updated the previously forgotten email instance of Joey Hess.


Version 0.89b September 19, 2001

* Merge from Debian package: Handle dummy SVGAlib failure gracefully.

* Merge from Debian package: Include description of the .thrustrc file in the
  man page originally contributed by Jonathan Eisenstein.

* Merge from Debian package: Joey Hess changed his email address *again*. ;-)

* Updated config.guess and config.sub.


Version 0.89a September 16, 2001

* Dag Asheim tripped on a bug when he designed a level. Sliders were not
  correctly connected to buttons when multple sets of buttons existed.

* The configure script failed to detect vga_getmodenumber in SVGAlib even
  if it was present.

* Cosmetic bug fixed in level6.def.


Version 0.89  August 18, 1998

* Thrust is now behaving better with respect to the laws of physics. It
  is the case when the ship and the blob are connected that has been
  updated. It should now be correct. I used the following passage from
  a physics text book as guidance:

  "The center of mass of a system of particles moves as if it were a
   particle of mass equal to the total mass of the system and subject
   to the external force applied to the system."

  Thanks to all the people (Mark Carroll, Timo Korvola, etc) who has mentioned
  the strangeness of loss of thrust when the ship and the blob are swinging all
  over the place.

* The ground is made visible when the shield is activated. Applicable to
  rounds where the ground is invisible. Thanks to Tim Waugh for pointing this
  out.

* Levels are incremented instead of reset to one when a new stage is
  entered.

* Port for Windows available. Bound to be buggy. Uses DirectX 3.0 which means
  that it runs on NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and on Windows 95/98.

* All .c files in datasrc/ are prebuilt in the source distribution.

* MSDOG version discontinued.

* Detection of the pbm library is now successful on systems where the library
  does not need any additional include/library dirs.

* The thrust sound wasn't silenced properly if quiting while thrusting. Thanks
  to Jan Djärv, who pointed this out.


Version 0.83c April 7, 1997

* Stupid me. You should only get 1000 units on fuel, not 5000.


Version 0.83b April 3, 1997

* A bug in the code that verifies that the level descriptions are correct
  caused a rejection of the first level. Thanks to Joey Hess who pointed this
  out. Shame on me for not testing prior to the release.


Version 0.83a April 1, 1997

* A restart point in level 6 caused unconditional death. Not so good, but now
  it's fixed. Thanks to Jan Djärv, who pointed this out.

* An icon (32x32) for Widows included. Thanx bro.


Version 0.83  March 21, 1997

* If two shots arrive at the same target at the same time, only that target is
  destroyed, not the target closest to the real target as well.

* Lowercase characters in the font.

* Cosmetic improvments. The amount of fuel left and the score is drawn in a box
  similar to the one in the original. The animation area was moved to the lower
  part of the screen, making room for the new box at the top of the screen. The
  ship appears more smooth when rotated. X11 icon included, it is not just a
  noisy square anymore.

* X11 demo is only run if the window has focus.

* X11 keyboard handling is better, still not handling Compose though.

* The option --step which makes Thrust skip the drawing of two out of three
  frames and the option --double which draws Thrust in a bigger X window.
  However, --double is incredibly slow.

* Instructions include the silly background story; supplied by Wolfram Kleff
  over a year ago.

* The Power Plant is not destoyed until the countdown is ended. When the count-
  down ends, all objects explode. Do that in level five for maximum on screen
  explosive effect (10 objects simultaneously exploding, if you have the Pod).

* In the SVGAlib version, the names of the keys are pulled out of the kernel in
  the same way as the utility "dumpkeys" is doing this. As a consequence, some
  keys have changed their names, so you might have to edit your .thrustrc file.

* Thrust runs on MSDOG. Indrek Mandre pointed me in the direction of DJGPP and
  a port of SVGAlib which made it a rather easy task, but I still really really
  detest MSDOG.


Version 0.79c February 25, 1997

* The "About"-code segfaulted, and so did the gamma correction option handling
  in some cases. Both are fixed.


Version 0.79b February 22, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Another silly play_sound=0; assignment.


Version 0.79a February 21, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Silly play_sound=0; statement removed.


Version 0.79  February 20, 1997

* Changed the interaction between the ship and the blob when they are connected
  and the ship is accelerated. The new behaviour is more correct and more like
  the original.

* Sound added to the Linux version. Uses the SoundIt library written by Brad
  Pitzel (pitzel@cs.sfu.ca). Sound was added to thrust by Maik Roeder.
  In addition, SoundIt has been adapted so that sound works for Solaris,
  SunOS and HP-UX as well, but only if the sound device supports linear
  encoding.

* Configurable keys. Configuration is stored in ${HOME}/.thrustrc which is read
  at startup. See the included file "thrustrc" for an example of how .thrustrc
  can be written.

* X version understand the -display and -geometry options.

* Support for X-servers not capable of MIT shared memory.

* Added an option --gamma with which you can change the brightness of the
  colors.

* New rules applies for advancement to the next level. Also, there is a maximum
  altitude.

* 750 points (instead of 700) are given when the bunkers are shot down.

* Messages between the levels and a game over message.

* Portability changes. The X version now builds on Linux, Ultrix 4.5, OSF1 4.0,
  OpenBSD 2.0, Solaris 2.4/2.5, HP-UX 10.20, Irix 4.0.5, AIX 4.2 and SunOS 4.1.
  Very likely a whole bunch of others. Fix for OpenBSD by Kenneth Stailey, the
  rest by myself.


Version 0.73  January 14, 1997

* Added syncronization for fast systems. The X version was way too fast for
  some systems.


Version 0.71  January 13, 1997

* Preliminary X11 support. Only works with servers capable of MIT shared memory
  and limited to visuals with 8 bits per pixel pseudocolor.

* Compatibility changes and the use of GNU autoconf makes it possible to run
  the game on Solaris 2.5. With some luck, it works for other unices as well.

* The fired shots can destroy targets even when the hit is not on the screen.

* Fixed the door used in level 6.

* Made the mass of the blob configurable (REL_MASS in src/thrust.h). The mass
  of the blob is given in relation to the mass of the ship. The value is also
  changed from the previous 1.0 to 0.8 in responce to some requests.

* Updated man page. Most of the needed information is in there.

* Some memory allocation misfeatures corrected by Maik Roeder.

* Fixed the makefile. It didn't work if you didn't have the directory where the
  binary was supposed to be installed.
  Thanks go to Martin Wickman who pointed this out.

* Removed the bindist target from the Makefile in the binary distribution.

* Enabled the use of svga modes larger than 320x200. The game is simply drawn
  in a small area of the larger screen. Option --svgamode added. I've been able
  to play in 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768.
  Start with 'thrust -s G640x480x256'. 320x200 is still the default.


Version 0.67  December 22, 1996

* Fixed the nasty little bug which caused some "unexplainable" deaths. It must
  have been there for ages, but hasn't triggered prior to v0.61.

* Level 6 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff. The door is still in
  need of some work as you will notice when you get there. The level is
  playable though.

* Fixed a small cosmetic bug in level 5.

* Joey Hess changed his email address *again*. ;-)


Version 0.61  December 19, 1996

* Level 5 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff.

* New and improved title picture. Supplied by Christian Janoff.


Version 0.59  December 11, 1995

* Configurable keys.

* The guns are silent for a while when the plant has been hit. Thanks go to
  Wolfram Kleff since he pointed out this behaviour.

* Fixed a small bug with the teleport bars.

* Responds to the arguments -v, --version, -h and --help.

* Changed the internal representation of the definitions of the levels to make
  it easier to enter the block codes (was ½ and others, now normal ASCII).

* A breif description of how to make your own level.

* Man page, maintained by Joey Hess (joey@kitenet.net).

* Binary version compiled ELF, not a.out.


Version 0.53  November 6, 1995

* ELF-problem fixed. Thanks go to Mirko Streckenbach. Now it should compile on
  ELF systems as well.

* The game enters a demo mode if not touched.

* The teleport bars at the end of a completed level.

* The game is now not as quick as it was before, making it easier.


Version 0.47

* Can't remember. That's why I'm starting this list.


Version 0.41

* The first version released for Linux and SVGAlib. Before this, the versions
  wasn't numbered.

The first version got on the way when I discovered that my new fancy computer
was able to update the whole screen in every retrace of the monitor. This must
have been in 1993 or 1994 with my 486DX50. Not a very efficient way of
scrolling, but this is still how it works.
