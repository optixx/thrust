Thrust

I started to code Thrust for MSDOG but later I had a revelation so now it is
converted to X and Linux/SVGAlib. Nowadays it is also converted to Windows
(DirectX) and SDL.

This copy of the source tree now only maintains the SDL1.2 port that compiles
on modern macOS. The legacy SVGA, X11, and DirectX backends have been removed.

This is the game from the C64 that you cannot live without.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

There is a web page that is supposed to be up to date. You can find it at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~peda/thrust/, and it should contain information
about the latest developement. It also contains information to help you build
your own levels.

Thrust is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

Please send comments and bug reports by email to the address below.
