Thrust

This repository now maintains the modern SDL2-based port of Thrust on macOS. All of the legacy SVGA, X11, DirectX, and other platform-specific backends have been removed so the codebase only builds and runs with SDL2/modern macOS tooling.

Build instructions:

  * `make all` – rebuilds the assets (via `helpers/asset_tool.py`) and compiles `sdlthrust`.
  * `make clean` – deletes generated assets, object files, and the `sdlthrust` binary.
  * Set `SDLCONFIG` to a custom `sdl2-config` if you do not want to use the system default; the makefile falls back to `/opt/homebrew` and `/Library/Frameworks` paths on macOS.

Configuration defaults and key mappings live in the sample `thrust.rc` shipped with the project. The game looks for `thrust.rc` in the current working directory so you can clone the repo and run `./sdlthrust` alongside that file without touching your home directory.

SDL sound is always enabled — there is no `HAVE_SOUND` guard anymore — so the SDL mixer is the only supported sound backend.

Additional resources:

  * http://www.lysator.liu.se/~peda/thrust/ for the history of the game.
  * `COPYING` for the full licensing conditions.
